# The_ComplEat_Food
 I designed and developed a visually appealing and user-friendly static website for a cafe using HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates my expertise in front-end web development, with a focus on creating an engaging user experience. The website features an attractive layout, showcasing the cafe's menu offerings, customer reviews, and an intuitive order section. By leveraging HTML and CSS, I ensured seamless navigation, responsive design, and consistent branding throughout the site. Excited to have created a digital presence that enhances the cafe's online visibility and customer engagement.
